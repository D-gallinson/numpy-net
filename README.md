# numpy-net
A mini neural net library implemented entirely in Python/Numpy

This was designed purely as an exercise for myself to better play with some of the concepts undergirding deep learning. The library is wholly based off of PyTorch, and using the library resembles utilization of PyTorch (albeit a very basic, feature-poor version of it). The library is minimally optimized (does not run on the GPU at all) and should thus be used with caution. For smaller datasets (e.g. MNIST), it works alright but I don't believe it will perform well on anything much bigger.
